Declarative Animations – Define animations directly in JSX with the animate prop.
Gestures & Interactions – Handle hover, tap, drag, and while-in-view animations effortlessly.
Layout Animations – Automatically animate elements when their layout changes.
Scroll-Based Animations – Create effects triggered by scrolling.
Variants – Define reusable animation states.
Optimized Performance – Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth motion.
